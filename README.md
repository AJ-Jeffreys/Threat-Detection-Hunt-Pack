# 🛡️ Threat Detection Hunt Pack (Healthcare Focused)

This repository showcases custom detection logic and behavioral hunt queries I’ve developed for **Microsoft Defender (KQL)** and **CrowdStrike LogScale**, tailored for the healthcare sector.

Each detection aligns with **MITRE ATT&CK**, emphasizes **noise reduction and baseline tuning**, and includes a **triage playbook** for rapid analyst response.

## ⚙️ Contents

| Hunt Name | ATT&CK Techniques | Category | Description |
|------------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Office to Script Encoded Command | T1059.001, T1204.002 | Execution | Detects Office apps spawning scripting engines with encoded payloads |
| Recon Burst from Risky Parents | T1016, T1033, T1087 | Discovery | Identifies multiple recon commands within short time windows |

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
 
Each detection is designed to:
- Emphasize **high signal, low noise**.  
- Include **allowlists** and **NoiseTerms** for environment tuning.  
- Provide **clear triage steps** that map to attacker behaviors.

## 🧭 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Each detection includes:
- `technique_id`
- `tactic`
- `data_source`
- `severity`
- `status: hunting | analytic | alert`

Example YAML snippet:
```yaml
id: 01
name: OfficeToScript_EncodedCommand
tactics: [Execution]
techniques: [T1059.001, T1204.002]
data_source: DeviceProcessEvents
status: analytic
severity: High
